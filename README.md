# pete-thinkful
This project was to push us into putting everything we have learned thus far in web development into one web page project. This page is about an artist name Pete Thinkful and he is wanting to hire us to create a page that works as a portfolio for his artwork. We are to create a webpage close to the mock up to present to the internet. 
I am a current student in the web page development program with chegg and have been in this prpogram for about 3 weeks and am happy with the progression that is being displayed with my work.
all intial coding and basic skeletal structure was provided by chegg, and images as well as css styling
